This is an undercover program for you to troll someone with a rickroll,



The Program that imitates a Bsod was not me who did,
 I used the Bsod Simulator,
 made by FlyTech Videos and ALL credits of Bsod Simulator go to it.

 And ALL other programs was done by me,
 I used DevC++/DevCPP to do,
 if you want the C++ code it is located in DevCPP,
 there have two folders one for Asset 1,
 and another from the file how to receive the robux.exe
 
 Press F7 on keyboard to Exit the fake BSOD
